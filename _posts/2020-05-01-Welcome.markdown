Hello and Welcome to Beakperformance!  
We are three software developers who are interested in distributed systems and embedded programming.
We use this blog to write about a project dealing with the detection classification and localisation of birds.
For the hardware we use Bluepill boards and standard microphones.
The software will mainly be written with Rust.
Feel free to reach out if you have any comments, feedback or even help
