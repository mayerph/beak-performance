Hello and Welcome to Beakperformance!  
We are three master students who are interested in distributed systems and embedded programming.
We use this blog to write about a university project dealing with the detection classification and localisation of birds.
For the hardware we use Bluepill boards and standard microphones.
The software will mainly be written with Rust without the use of the standard libary.
Feel free to reach out if you have an comments, feedback or even help
